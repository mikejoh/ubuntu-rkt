# Ubuntu rkt-demo

I created this Vagrant box to demo rkt at a meetup, you could also use the CoreOS provided Vagrant box for start using and testing rkt. Created this repo for reference.

The Vagrant box are bootstrapped with the provided script, if you change anything in that file you'll need to run `vagrant up --provision` to re-provision the box.

## How-to
1. Download Vagrant
2. Run `vagrant up` within the cloned directory containing the `Vagrantfile`
